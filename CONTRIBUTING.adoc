=== Quality Tools

All quality tools are configured via Gradle convention plugins. No IDE plugins are required.

**Available Commands**:

* `./gradlew spotlessApply` - Auto-format code (Java formatter based on link:src/main/resources/java-formatter.xml[Eclipse formatter])
* `./gradlew qualityCheck` - Run all quality checks (Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs) without tests
* `./gradlew qualityGate` - Run quality checks + auto-format
* `./gradlew check` - Full verification (quality checks + tests)

**Quality Rules**:

* link:src/main/resources/checkstyle.xml[Checkstyle rules]
* link:src/main/resources/pmdRuleset.xml[PMD rules]
* link:src/main/resources/spotbugs-filter.xml[SpotBugs filter]

=== Git Pre-commit Hook

A Git pre-commit hook is configured via Gradle to automatically run quality checks before each commit. This ensures that code quality standards are enforced before changes are committed to the repository.

The hook runs `qualityCheck` and will block commits that fail the quality checks.
